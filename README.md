## Our Revision Report : [Revision Report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KrS4LxxDu5PNEDDL7Kq2CilWm1ZMtfKtREevRrvxRUw/edit#slide=id.p)
## Dataset Used Source : [Kaggle - train-num2-var by bhh258](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhh258/train-num2-var)
## ðŸ“¦ dataset download process
(The dataset used in this repository is not included in the GitHub repository due to size and license constraints. Please follow the instructions below to download it.)

### 1. install Kaggle CLI toolsï¼š
   ```bash
   pip install kaggle
   ```
### 2. install kaggle.json (If you've already done this before, just skip this step.)
### 3-1. Manual download
   ```bash
   kaggle datasets download -d bhh258/train-num2-var --unzip
   # You might be prompted to accept the license by typing "y" or "yes".
   ```
### 3-2. Automatic download (recommend)
   ```bash
      python download_dataset.py
      # The script will handle download, unzip, and license agreement automatically.
   ```
### 4. Split dataset
   ```bash
      python split_dataset.py
      # This script will automatically split the downloaded dataset into training, validation, and test sets (by length and with a fixed seed for reproducibility).
   ```
   (After Spliting, you can delete the original dataset downloaded at step 3 if you want. We will no longer use it.)
##  Training a model for recognizing verification codes
### 1. install environment
We recommend using Python 3.8 or above.
#### Use GPU (recommend)
Please install the correct version of PyTorch that matches your systemâ€™s CUDA version (instructions not provided here).
#### Using CPU Only
You can use :
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```
#### Other libraries
All other required libraries are listed in "requirements.txt".
You can install them with the following command :
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2. Start Recognizing
```bash
python Recognize.py
# Average runtime: approximately 35 minutes
```
##Results: Test accuracy is about 65%
